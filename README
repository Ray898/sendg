 * sendg.cs
 * Send gcode to Ultimaker via serial port.
 * (c) 2011 Peter Brier. pbrier.nl - gmail.com
 *
 * Requires Mono or MS C# to compile (mono-gmcs is only required to compile). For example:
 * # sudo apt-get install mono-gmcs mono-gac mono-utils
 * # gmcs sendg.cs
 * # mono sendg.exe
 *
 * USE: sendg -d -l -c[buffercount] -p[portname] -b[baudrate] [filename]
 * -d             Enable debugging
 * -l             Enable logging
 * -e             Enable build time estimation
 * -c[n]          Set delayed ack count (1 is no delayed ack)
 * -p[name]       Specify portname (COMx on windows, /dev/ttyAMx on linux)
 * -b[baudrate]   Set baudrate (default is 115200)
 * [filename]     The GCODE file to send
 * 
 * Best results are obtained when c>3, however, your firmware serial buffer should be large 
 * enough to hold all these lines
 *
 * Two threads are used (a reader and main thread).
 * Note: we do *NOT* use the async events of the SerialPort object.
 * these have 'issues' on mono (one of the 'issues' is that they don't work).
 *
 * Upto "bufcount" lines are sent, before they are ACK-ed
 * A semaphore is used to sync the threads.
 * We assume all these lines fit in the 128 byte serial buffer of
 * the arduino. An optimized version could cound the actual nr of
 * bytes sent and ACKed to sync the reader/writer.
 * No CRC, line-numbers or resents are implemented.
 * Tested with standard ultimaker and sprinter firmware, 
 * using bufcount=2
